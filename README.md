## About 
I wanted to create a game inspired by one of my favorite things in the world -- coffee! This game is an interactive card game, where players have to match cards to their complement in order to win. All of the cards are coffee ingredients -- milk, sugar, coffee-beans, a straw, and honey. When you first click the game, an interactive module will pop up and let you know the instructions. As you browse the page, you can optionally turn on some music. Right next to the actual card game, there is a random coffee recipe generator, inspired by all the lovely delicious cups of coffee I've had from different places. I even came up with the design for the logo and brought it to life in canva!
